# cardTrick
A simple card trick built with AngularJs
So the logic here is pretty simple. A player thinks of a card from the displayed cards,
Then he/she taps the group the group containing the card either 1,2 3... e.t.c
The game redisplays the cards again and the player to repeat the step as before after which now the
game will determine the player's card.

Fun and easy enough, play around with it if you will and tell me what other opions you come up with. 
You can even implement your own card tricks or game. Tell me what you are able to do with it..... reach me here: wakyinc@gmail.com.  Cheers!!
